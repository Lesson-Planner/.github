## üöÄ Overview
Lesson Planner is a professional tool for **teachers, tutors, and educators** who need to create structured, effective lesson plans without the chaos of paper notes or scattered files. Built for macOS, it combines scheduling, content organization, and progress tracking into a single intuitive platform.  

Instead of juggling spreadsheets, notebooks, and multiple apps, Lesson Planner gives you one place to map out entire courses, organize lessons day by day, attach resources, and monitor student progress.  

It is designed for different teaching contexts: **classroom teaching, online tutoring, homeschooling, university lectures, and workshops.** The app adapts to your workflow, whether you‚Äôre planning one lesson at a time or designing a multi-week curriculum.  

The goal is simple: to help educators **save time, reduce stress, and teach more effectively** by having every detail organized ‚Äî from objectives and activities to assessments and follow-ups.
